# Habit-Tracker
This here is a program that I have taken on as a personal project. This program here tracks if you have done the habit or not.
In this first version, it asks the user if they want to add a new habit, update their habits, or check their progress.
If they want to add a habit, they type the name of the habit that they want to add, if they want to update their habits, the program then proceeds to ask if they have completed it or not.
If they want to check their progress, the program then in the current directory writes a csv file that shows them if they completed the habit or not.
